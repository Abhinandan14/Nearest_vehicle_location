# Nearest_vehicle_location

######## This is a 30min - 3hr assignment for evaluation pre-selection for an internship

the program connects to a database locally. 

The database contains table "locations".
the attributes are location_ID, location_X, location_Y
the rows have 100 entries and are populated randomly using a procedure

The program has a GUI to enter the user's X,Y inputs
Using EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE the top 5 nearest location_ID were extracted from the database

The complexity is O(n), not including the time complexity of sort() function.
